# The Flash App
**Background:**

The Flash App is a study tool which relies on the science of spaced repetition! 

What does that mean? If you know a card, it will show up less often. If you miss one, it will come around again soon. The Flash App makes it so you don't have to worry about what to study, we use science to best direct your effort. 

Study less, learn more.
